Overview
Zombie Warframe Gameplay: "Zombie WarFrame" is a popular tower defense video game where players defend their suburban home from invading zombies. The game features a gridded lawn, with the player's house situated on the left side. Players strategically place various types of plants on individual squares of the grid, each offering unique defensive abilities such as shooting projectiles, exploding, or blocking zombies. Different types of zombies exhibit distinct behaviors and vulnerabilities to specific plants; for instance, the Balloon Zombie can float over plants but can be popped by the Cactus. Throughout the game, players must collect sunlight, the in-game currency, either by clicking on sun icons or using sun-generating plants like Sunflowers. Sun is used to purchase and place plants, with each plant requiring a specific amount of sunlight. Players can also use a shovel to remove plants if needed. Each lane features a single-use lawnmower, pool cleaner, and roof cleaner positioned at the left end, which activates to eliminate zombies if they reach that point. However, if a zombie reaches the end of a lane without an available cleaner, the player loses the level and must restart or exit.
